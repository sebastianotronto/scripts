These scripts are made to each do one thing well and be combined with each
other. Many are linked to a keybinding in my X session.

Feel free to copy them all or in part, read them, study them, take them apart,
copy-paste lines from them and publicly ridicule them as you like.

Send any suggestion for improvement at `sebastiano@tronto.net`.

I might add some examples here at some point, for now just look at the
source code.
