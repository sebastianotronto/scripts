* Modify all dmenu-* scripts to optionally use another menu, like vis-menu (slmenu)
  Do this by taking an optional $1 which is the name of the program to use
  (optional $dir argument is removed: fix dmenu-bookmarks simply using cd)
* Big problem: slmenu does not allow multiple selections; this is a problem
  for my workflow for sel and for sfeed-menu (and sometimes for open-file)
* Solution: leave dmenu default option, use slmenu for a selected few aliases in .profile

* mblaze-extras: remove mmv, just use complete_mrefile=mail/...

* sfeed-browser: optionally just write link to stdout (or to xsel -i)

* Refactor: review all scripts and adapt to common style
  Configuration file (read only at "make" time) for default apps etc..

* Find a proper copy-left license
